			<p>Wielding nothing more than a hadful of papers and a chime, the priest stepped forward. Clad in the robes of their monastary, the priest precisely throws one of its paper talismans towards the enemy ranks. In the next moment, with the snap of a finger, the paper erupts into a confligration that engulfs the soldiers.</p>
			<p class="indent">Surrounded by foes, the gnome manifests several glowing talismans inscribed with magical symbols to hover about her head. With the wave of her hands, the spectral pages fly towards her foes, slicing through them. In the next instant, the talismans fly back towards her, carving additional wounds along the way and returning to their hovering possition in preperation.</p>
			<p class="indent">In a room dimly lit by a floating wisp, a human skillfully inscribes mysterious symbols to a piece of paper. The wisp suddenly bursts with light, revealing a spectre from beyond. With a deep breath he holds the paper in his hand. A flare of spiritual energy surges forth, dispatching the spectre and causing the wisp to go dim once again. </p>    
      <p class="indent">Coming from the same monastic background as monks, Priests are those who prefer to focus their discipline towards more mystical arts. Their devoted study of scripture and diciplined practice of calligraphy gives them the ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. They can utilize this energy to manipulate objects, conjure spirits, and manifest elemental effects. Priest often study from other schools or profession to expand their knowledge, making inscriptions based on magical text that allow them to cast spells from those schools with ki.</p>

      <h4>INSCRIPTION MAGIC</h4>
			<p>A Priest is defined by it's unique list of spells and the use of Ki points as a resource for those spells. As their mastery of magical text improves, they're able to cast spells from other schools of magic using ki. The priest can also cast spells remotely using their magical talismans, giving them a unique role on the battlefield. Although they accel at support, priests often lack in range.</p>

			<h4>CREATING A PRIEST </h4>
			<p>As you make your priest character, think about your connection to the monastary where you learned and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastary’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastary in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?</p>
			<p class="indent">As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, priests are often lawful in alignment, however; due to their thirst for knowledge and eccentric nature, other alignments are not unheard of.</p>
			<p class="indent">What drew you forth from your life of discipline? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Were you sent on an important mission beyond the cloister? Have you received word of a historic repository of text never seen by your monastary? Perhaps you were even cast out for delving into forbidden scripture.</p>

			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>

			<p>At 1st level, you gain access to the Priest school of spells and use Ki to cast them. The Priest table shows the maximum level that you can cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend ki points equal to the level with which you cast it.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At first level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Priest spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown on the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.</p>
			<h5>Spells Known of 1st Level or Higher</h5>
			<p>You	know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Priest spell list. The Spells Known column of the Priest table shows when you learn more spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast as shown on the Priest table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Priest spells you know from this feature and replace it with another spell from the Priest spell list. The new spell must also be of a level you can cast as shown on the Priest table.</p>
			<h5>Hand Signs</h5>
			<p>You can cast Priest spells you know without a focus if you have 2 free hands. Your hands imitate magical symbols, manefesting flourecent visages of those symbols to evoke the spell. The symbols are often organized in a magical circle, but unorthadox methods exist.</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
			<p>You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for spells you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>MAGIC CIRCLES</h5>
			<p>You can cast a priest spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. You don’t need to have the spell prepared. You do so by inscribing the spell directly on or around the target.</p>

Other's might devote themselves entirely to monastic scripture as a Devotee, channeling divine power and cleric spells with their ki. Some simply wish to understanding the flow of nature as a Naturalist, altering their form to match their environment or accomplish tasks.</p>

Make an Intelligence check (DC = CR+10 if it's a creature or 12 for a common item adding 1 for each rarity step above common) using art supplies you're proficient with, creating an exact copy of the chosen object on a success. If it is a creature, it's stats are identical to the chosen creature and it is friendly towards you. If you choose an item, the creation is identical to the chosen item. This process takes longer the larger the object. A large object requires 8 short rests or 1 long rest, repeating the skill check each time. A huge object takes 16 short rests or 2 long rests. (you must sacrifice this time to do so, suffering exhaustion as normal). The manifested creation lasts up to 1 hour, and requires concentration like a spell. If you concentrate on this ability for the duration, the creation lasts until you use this ability again. This ability costs the objects value, or its weight in gold, whichever is higher.</p>

The Scribe table shows the maximum level that you can cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend ki points equal to the spells level.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Weapon Inscriptions. </i></b>You can write Inscriptions on your weapons, attuning to them. You can use a weapon you are attuned to as an Arcane Focus for your spells.</p>
            <p>Your Inscribed weapons can deliver your spells as if it had cast the spell, at a range of 5ft. or less. The Inscribed weapon must be within 100 feet of you. If the spell requires an Attack roll, you use your Attack modifier for the roll. If the spell requires a weapon, use the Inscribed weapon.</p>
            <p>You gain proficiency with katanas. </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn two cantrips: Return and one other cantrips of your choice from the Inscription spell list. You learn another cantrip of your choice at the 6th, 11th and 16th level.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Inscriptions Known. </i></b>You know two 1st level Priest spells of your choice from the Inscription spells list. The Spells Known column of the Scribe table shows when you learn more Priest spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an Inscription spell of your choice, and must be of a level of which you can cast.</p>
            <p>You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when making an attack roll with a spell. </p>
            <p>You use your Ki save DC for your Spell save DC.</p>
            <p class="center">
                <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
            <p class="center">
                <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
            <p><b>Inscription Restrictions.</b> Enchantment, Evocation, and Necromancy schools of magic cannot be inscribed as they stray too far from monastic teachings and tradition. As such, no Inscriptions can match their particular magics, and you cannot cast these spells with ki points even if you learn them.</p>

      <p class="indent">Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is considered undead and it can speak any languages you know.</p>
      <p class="indent">The creature is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, the familiar shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.</p>
      <p class="indent">When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.</p>
      <p class="indent">As an action, you can turn your familiar invisible. Maintaining this invisibility requires you to concentrate as if on a spell. As a reaction on your turn, you can have the familiar appear in an unoccupied space within the spells range of you or the familiar. Doing so causes you to lose concentration.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can’t have more than one spirit familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a spirit familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose a creature you've seen with a CR of 1/8 or less. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>

      <p>You manifest a phantasmal copy of yourself. The illusion is telepathically linked to you, allowing you to perceive through both at once. it has half your current hit points. If the clone is killed, you take psycic damage equal to the clones maximum hp. You give the copy any number of your prepared spells when you create it. On your turn, you can use actions from the phantasm instead of yourself and the phantasm can cast any spells you gave it. You cannot use the spells from yourself during this time, or vice-versa. For instance, you can have the phantasm move and use fling, then you could use return as your bonus, ending your turn. You would not, however; be able to use fling while your clone has this Insription on it, and it will not be able to use return. Use your spell DC, spell modifier and attack modifiers. The phantom, as well as it's equipment, seem realistic to the senses but can not reproduce any of the equipments magical effects.</p>
