        <p class="flavor"> Resembling small, tough, and elderly human men or undersized wizened gnomes. They have hunched backs, wiry muscles, leathery skins, and evil smiles filled with wickedly sharp, protruding teeth. They wear bright-red leather pointed caps for which they were named; these are always soaked in fresh blood. They wield scythes, sickles, or other heavy bladed weapons that seem much too big for them.</p>
